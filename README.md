# Design Experiments

A Next.js-based sandbox for exploring visual design systems, widgets, and interactive patterns.

> **Heads up:** This is a personal sandbox -- me coding in public. Experiments get added, removed, and rewritten all the time. Feel free to browse, but don't depend on anything here staying put.

This is a design sketchbook, not production software. There's no test suite and that's intentional -- the point is rapid experimentation and learning in public, not shipping stable APIs. Things break, get rewritten, and disappear without notice.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start Next.js dev server on port 3000
npm run build  # Build for production
npm start      # Run production build
```

## Blog

The site includes a markdown-powered blog at [joshcoolman.com/blog](https://www.joshcoolman.com/blog) with posts on design, AI agents, and working with code. Posts live in `blog/` as `.md` files with frontmatter.

**[View Blog →](https://www.joshcoolman.com/blog)**

---

## Recommended

A curated collection of links -- YouTube videos, GitHub repos, and web tools -- with personal commentary and auto-fetched thumbnails. New links are added via the `/recommend` skill. Each item is a markdown file with frontmatter (url, date, optional title) and a one-line comment.

Thumbnails resolve automatically at build time: YouTube via oEmbed, GitHub via OG images, and web links via manual screenshots taken with agent-browser.

## Adding New Experiments

1. Create `app/design-experiments/[name]/page.tsx` with your React component
2. Add screenshot to `public/screenshots/[name].png`
3. Add experiment to `lib/experiments/data.ts`
4. Update this README with experiment details

## Claude Code Skills

This repo includes custom skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that streamline common development workflows. While not all skills are specific to this sandbox project, they're general-purpose utilities I use across different projects.

### Available Skills

**Design Experiment Pipeline:**

**`/sketch`**
Rapid visual prototyping -- paint with code. Two files (page.tsx + styles.css), plain CSS with descriptive class names, no component libraries, no data layer. The napkin drawing before the architecture.

**`/design-experiment`**
Create a new design experiment in the sandbox. Scaffolds the route, page, and styles following project conventions.

**`/design-audit`**
Audit a design experiment's CSS for color and type consistency. Extracts every color and font-size, flags near-duplicates, suggests unifications. Interactive -- select which fixes to apply.

**`/animation-audit`**
Audit a design experiment for entrance animations, stagger timing, and interaction feedback. Proposes spring presets for consistency and wires up click-to-replay.

**`/ts-handoff`**
Light TypeScript cleanup to make components handoff-ready. Catches real bugs and hygiene issues without over-engineering. The final pass before shipping.

**`/promote`**
Make a design experiment importable. Runs the full quality pipeline, extracts components, designs a public API, and creates a barrel export.

**`/ship-experiment`**
Ship a design experiment: screenshots with agent-browser, updates gallery and README, commits and pushes to GitHub.

**Content:**

**`/recommend`**
Add a link to the Recommended page. Pass a URL and a comment -- the skill detects the source type (YouTube, GitHub, web), creates a markdown file, handles screenshots for web links, and runs a production build to trigger thumbnail downloads.

**`/blog-post`**
Draft a blog post from conversation context. Creates markdown with a placeholder image, immediately visible on the homepage and blog index.

**`/note`**
Quick-fire a sticky note from the command line. Everything after `/note` becomes a new markdown file with auto-derived filename and rotating color.

**Utilities:**

**`/sanity-check`**
Quick React/TypeScript/Next.js code review from a senior engineer perspective. Catches common issues and suggests practical improvements.

**`/supabase`**
Supabase CLI wrapper for database operations: schema migrations, TypeScript type generation, edge function deployment, and postgres best practices.

**`/bitmap-to-vector`**
Convert raster images (PNG, JPG, etc.) to clean, icon-ready SVG vectors using potrace. Auto-detects threshold and polarity, strips bounding rectangles, outputs `fill="currentColor"` SVGs ready for inline use or CSS masks.
