          This experiment started with a handful of product photos&mdash;close-ups
          of audio equipment, machined knobs, brushed aluminum panels. The kind of
          objects where every shadow has a reason and every radius was chosen by an
          engineer with strong opinions. The question was simple: could we recreate
          that physicality in the browser?
        </p>
        <p>
          The process was entirely conversational. No wireframes, no mockups. Just
          voice dictation driving an agent that writes code. &ldquo;The shadow
          shouldn&rsquo;t rotate with the knob&mdash;only the notch moves.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;The drag should be left-right, not circular.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those
          numbers can&rsquo;t shift when the value changes&mdash;pad with zeros.&rdquo;
          Each observation pushed the fidelity higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          The equalizer was a turning point. Animated bars were eye candy until the
          low, mid, and high controls started driving them. Suddenly a static layout
          became an instrument. The frequency and gain readouts followed&mdash;fixed-width
          numerals that update without jittering, lit slightly brighter than the
          surrounding chrome to suggest a backlit display.

          The track name scramble was a late addition, borrowed from a Terminator-style
          text effect built in a separate experiment. It had no business working here,
          but it did. That kind of cross-pollination is what makes this sandbox worth
          maintaining&mdash;ideas migrate between experiments without planning.
