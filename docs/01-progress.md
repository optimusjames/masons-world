### Docs Viewer

**Date:** 2026-02-09

Added a `/docs` route that renders markdown files from the `docs/` directory with sidebar navigation, syntax highlighting, table of contents with scroll spy, and dark mode styling.

**What changed:**
- New route group `app/(docs)/` with layout, catch-all slug page, and index redirect
- Utility library `lib/docs/` for scanning the docs directory, parsing filenames, extracting headings
- Client components for sidebar (collapsible categories, mobile drawer), TOC (IntersectionObserver scroll spy), and code blocks (react-syntax-highlighter with VS Code Dark+ theme)
- Server-rendered markdown via next-mdx-remote/rsc with remark-gfm and rehype-slug
- Dark mode CSS Modules with Bitter serif font on headings to match homepage brand
- Homepage redesigned from single text link to two card-style nav links (Design Experiments + Docs)
- Ported 3 reference docs from the notes vault: AI Dev Stack 2026, BYOK Pattern, Stack Overview
- Files prefixed with `_` are excluded from the sidebar (used for templates)
- Subdirectories in `docs/` become collapsible categories; numeric prefixes control sort order

**Key files:**
- `app/(docs)/layout.tsx` - Docs layout with sidebar
- `app/(docs)/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx` - Doc renderer with TOC
- `app/(docs)/_components/` - DocsSidebar, TableOfContents, CodeBlock, DocsContent
- `lib/docs/loadDocs.ts` - Core logic for scanning and loading docs
- `app/(docs)/docs.module.css` - All docs styling
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage with card nav links
- `docs/stack/` - Ported reference documentation

**Dependencies added:**
- gray-matter, remark-gfm, rehype-slug, react-syntax-highlighter, next-mdx-remote, lucide-react

### TypeScript Migration & Component Architecture

**Date:** 2026-02-08

Completed comprehensive TypeScript migration and established component extraction patterns for the design experiments sandbox.

**What changed:**
- Converted all 7 experiments from `.jsx` to `.tsx` with full type safety
- Added TypeScript type definitions (`@types/react-dom`, `@types/chroma-js`)
- Refactored `color-spec` from monolithic 2000+ line file into modular component architecture
- Established clear guidelines in CLAUDE.md for when to extract vs keep single-file

**Key files:**
- All `app/*/page.tsx` - TypeScript conversion
- `app/color-spec/components/*` - Extracted reusable components
- `app/color-spec/hooks/useColorScale.ts` - Color generation utilities
- `app/color-spec/data/fontPairings.ts` - Static data extraction
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added component architecture guidance

**Benefits:**
- Full type safety across all experiments
- Easier to port components to other projects
- Clear separation of concerns in complex experiments
- Better AI agent collaboration on component extraction
